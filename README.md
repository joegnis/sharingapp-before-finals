# Sharingapp (before finals/module4)

You should be able to compile and run this right after opening it in Android Studio

Tested with
- Android Studio Ladybug | 2024.2.1 Patch 3
- Windows 11

Project configuration
- Android compileSdk 34, minSdk 29, targetSdk 33
- gradle 8.9

I am using Windows so I don't if it can run right away on other platforms. If Android Studio prompts you to fix something, just press yes and things should be good.

Hope this can help!
